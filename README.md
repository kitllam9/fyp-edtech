# Installation

1. Install Flutter on your environment. (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) </br>
   Note that the project is developed for both Android and IOS, so both Windows and MacOS versions of the SDK should be available.

2. Clone the repository, or unzip the compressed source code files.

3. If the process does not start automatically when the project is opened in an IDE, acquire the external packages by running `flutter pub get`

4. Start an emulator and make sure it is connected.

5. Start the web application of the project (See https://github.com/kitllam9/fyp-edtech-web) and run this Flutter project with `flutter run` or run the `main.dart` through an IDE's GUI.
